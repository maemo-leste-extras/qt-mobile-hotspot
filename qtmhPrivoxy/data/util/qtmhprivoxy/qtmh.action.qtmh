# QTMH will add its own settings here.
# The file qtmh.action.qtmh is just a sample we use.
# The real action file is generated using it, and is called qtmh.action .
# The real action file is deleted after hotspot shutdown.
# The settings which will be appended are so far :
# { +hide-user-agent{$$USERAGENT$$} }
# / # All websites

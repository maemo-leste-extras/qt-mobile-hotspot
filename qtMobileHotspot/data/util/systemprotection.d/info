Packages should create here their system protection scripts.
Those have to be .sh files and must be executable.

Protection scripts must return 0 if everything was fine, and any other value in case of problem (also they should try to solve it).
The top-level system protection script will perform a global connectivity reset if at least one protection script detects a problem.
